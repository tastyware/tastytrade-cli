# for example, with a VIX of 25, BP usage of 40%, and variation of 10,
# you'd be warned for high BP usage since the acceptable range would be
# VIX - variation < BP% < VIX + variation. you may also be warned for
# low usage if you're perceived to be using your capital inefficiently;
# e.g. with a VIX of 25, BP usage of 10%, and variation of 10.
